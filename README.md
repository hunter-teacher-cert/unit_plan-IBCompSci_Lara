# COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE 
for IB Digital Societies and IB Computer Science
Erwin and Parmanand

-----

### General Overview
Unit Description: Computer Organization is Topic 2 of the IB Computer Science course and is recommended to be taught over a minimum of 6 hours or 9-45 minute lessons and assessed over 2 lessons. 
The unit title is Computer Organization and is subdivided into 
* Computer Architecture
* Secondary Memory
* Operating Systems and application systems
* Binary representation
* Simple logic gates,

### Motivation for Unit
This is a lesson that may be used in __IB Digital Societies__ and __IB Computer Science__.
A unique component of IB classes is the requirement that all lessons must have elements of a core course called **Theory of Knowledge** and **Approaches to Learning**.
In simplest terms, every lesson must ask require the student to write and reflect on the question of _"how is this knowledge?"_ and _"how do you know this is knowledge"_. The ATL component requires research and communication in every unit and lesson if possible.

### Standards Referenced
Standards in the Unit: In addition to the IB Computer Science mandated standards - that includes elements of Theory of Knowledge(TOK) and International Mindedness (AIM8), this unit lesson plan addresses the following standard from the NYS standards.

**9.12.NSD.1 Design a solution to a problem that utilizes embedded systems to automatically gather input from the environment.** The emphasis is on designing (but not necessarily creating) solutions with embedded systems. Systems can be biological, mechanical, social, or some other type of system. Designs could include written descriptions, drawings, and/or 3D prototypes. 

**9.12.NSD.2  Explain the levels of interaction existing between the application software, system software, and hardware of a computing system.** Knowledge of specific advanced terms of computer architecture and how specific levels work is not required. Rather the progression, in general terms, from voltage to binary signal to logic gates and so on to the level of human interaction, should be explored. 

**9.12.NSD.3 Develop and communicate multi-step troubleshooting strategies others can use to identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components.** Some examples of multi-step troubleshooting problems include resolving connectivity problems, adjusting system configurations and settings, ensuring hardware and software compatibility, and transferring data from one device to another. 

**9-12.NSD.4 Describe the components and design characteristics that allow data and information to be moved, stored and referenced over the Internet** The focus is on understanding the design decisions that direct the coordination among systems composing the Internet that allow for scalability and reliability. Discussions should consider historical, cultural, and economic decisions related to the development of the Internet, as well as the core components of servers and routers.


### Tools Used

Teaching Framework required by NYC Brooklyn North, District 14 Superintendency - lessons must be planned to be small-group student-centered and direct teaching is discouraged. The 5-30-10 model is the recommended planning guide: 5 minutes of teacher-talk to introduce the lesson and lesson routines, 30-minutes of student-centered investigation, and a 10-minute lesson-recap at the end of the class that is intended to summarize the lesson and assess the overall learning level by the class. 

IB requires all lessons to have a Theory of Knowledge component, that all assessments must be concept-based and  involve writing reflections on every lesson. The IB assessment framework prohibits the use of multiple-choice type assessment.

In most of the lessons planned for HS for EBT, the **Harkness Method** of class discussion is the de-facto standard.
Approaches to Learning Components of IB Courses

**Andragogy v Pedagogy** - andragogy = teaching to adult learners (16-19 year old DP students)
IB DP students are considered emerging or early adults and the teaching approach is more andragogical than pedagogical.

Adult learners prefer to be responsible for their own learning and involved in the planning and evaluation of their instruction.
They can use their own life experience as a rich resource for learning; they prefer learning that is problem-centered rather than content-oriented.
They respond better to internal, rather than external, motivator; they need to understand the reason for, and importance, of all their learning.
Consequently, lessons must have research components and communication components.


**Harkness Teaching Protocol** - problem based learning protocol that emphasizes independent student work and discussion. The teacher is a facilitator and provides general questions for research and discussion by the students. Discussion and inquiry will be student-centered and lessons will be concept based.
