# COMPUTER ARCHITECTURE
Erwin and Parmanand

-----

### General Overview
Unit Description: Computer Organization is Topic 2 of the IB Computer Science course and is recommended to be taught over a minimum of 6 hours or 8-45 minute lessons and assessed over 2 lessons. The unit title is Computer Organization and is subdivided into Computer Architecture, Secondary Memory, Operating Systems and application systems, Binary representation, and Simple logic gates,

### Motivation for Unit
This is a lesson that may be used in IB Digital Societies and IB Computer Science.
A unique component of IB classes is the requirement that all lessons must have elements of a core course called Theory of Knowledge and Approaches to Learning.
In simplest terms, every lesson must ask require the student to write and reflect on the question of "how is this knowledge?" and "how do you know this is knowledge". The ATL component requires research and communication in every unit and lesson if possible.

### Standards Referenced
Standards in the Unit: In addition to the IB Computer Science mandated standards - that includes elements of Theory of Knowledge(TOK) and International Mindedness (AIM8), this unit lesson plan addresses the following standard from the NYS standards.

9.12.NSD.1 Design a solution to a problem that utilizes embedded systems to automatically gather input from the environment. The emphasis is on designing (but not necessarily creating) solutions with embedded systems. Systems can be biological, mechanical, social, or some other type of system. Designs could include written descriptions, drawings, and/or 3D prototypes. 

9.12.NSD.2  Explain the levels of interaction existing between the application software, system software, and hardware of a computing system. Knowledge of specific advanced terms of computer architecture and how specific levels work is not required. Rather the progression, in general terms, from voltage to binary signal to logic gates and so on to the level of human interaction, should be explored. 

9.12.NSD.3 Develop and communicate multi-step troubleshooting strategies others can use to identify and fix problems with computing devices and their components. Some examples of multi-step troubleshooting problems include resolving connectivity problems, adjusting system configurations and settings, ensuring hardware and software compatibility, and transferring data from one device to another. 

9-12.NSD.4 Describe the components and design characteristics that allow data and information to be moved, stored and referenced over the Internet The focus is on understanding the design decisions that direct the coordination among systems composing the Internet that allow for scalability and reliability. Discussions should consider historical, cultural, and economic decisions related to the development of the Internet, as well as the core components of servers and routers.


### Tools Used
(include programming language(s), specific programs/environments, and other tools (digital or otherwise) if necessary)

---

### Resources
(include any links/books/readings to be used during this unit)

### Lessons
Total lengtht: 2 Weeks


### Assesments
The summative assessment for this unit is an end of unit project that is open-ended task that asks students to produce evidence of synthesis of all the topics in the unit. 
Additionally, students are required to answer 4-5 questions that are taken from previous specimen questions from the IB exam, taken on the 2nd year of the course.
