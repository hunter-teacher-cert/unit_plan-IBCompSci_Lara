## Assesment Structure of IB Courses

There are no summative assessments in the IB until the IB Exams taken at the end the 2-year course, usually in May in NYC schools.

Unit Assessment in this context will be revision items (review = revision) which are based on the IB Assessment Standards that is included in the syllabus.

IB Computer Science and IB Digital Societies assessment items always require the student to write out a short reply to a prompt. IB Computer Science and IB Digital Societes 
do not use Multiple Choice Items for assessment.
